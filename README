An implementation of the mTZVP GTO basis set for GPW calculations with 
GTH pseudopotentials (for example in CP2K). This basis is part of the 
B97-3c low cost DFT approach of Brandenburg et al.: J. Chem. Phys 148, 
064104 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5012601

I have tried to create the best possible GTH-based analog of this 
basis by building a new basis from the following components:
- SZV-MOLOPT-SR
- The n - c "outermost" (smallest exponent) valence basis functions of 
  the actual mTZVP basis for each relevant angular momentum, where
  c is the number of "core" orbitals that are already covered by the
  pseudopotential or MOLOPT basis.
- Polarization functions of mTZVP

Note: mTZVP is mostly the def-TZVP basis, which in turn is 
essentially a subset of def2-TZVP. Modifications are most prominent 
for H and O.

The rationale behind my attempt is that I
1. Keep the total number of valence (& higher) basis functions intact
2. Don't need "core" basis functions because of the pseudopotential
3. Use the SZV MOLOPT basis as glue between the pseudo and mTZVP
4. Have the outermost basis functions be exactly mTZVP

Point (4) ought to guarantee that at least noncovalent interactions 
are as close to the true B97-3c result as possible.

I've seen/heard that people have used other, standard CP2K basis sets
with B97-3c, but at least some cohesive energy calculations seem to
suggest that my attempt is closer to results reported in the original 
B97-3c paper. I didn't do extensive checks, though, so we're still 
in "trust me bro" territory here.

I include an example ASE-based script to compute cohesive energies, 
with ice Ih as system. This runs quite quickly even on my decade-old
workstation. The B97-3c input deck is taken from Perlt et al.: J. 
Chem. Phys. 148, 193835 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5013122

These sets are provided "as is" and I can't give you any meaningful 
support, but perhaps you find them useful!
